<span class="location">Canonical Ltd. - Lexington, MA</span>
<span class="years">2011 – 2017</span>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Architect and developer on Keeper, Unity 8's cloud backup and restore tool. Evaluated approaches for our security model and customer requirements, presented design, and co-wrote Keeper with other developers.</li>
<li>Architect and developer on Ubuntu Pay Service's QtPurchasing implementation.</li>
<li>Ran Ubuntu Linux's <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-menu-bar">User Services / Indicators</a> project (services working behind those little panel icons). Worked with and coordinated teams of UX designers, QA, users, and developers to ensure features landed smoothly and bugs got fixed. Updated desktop services to also run on phones for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Touch">Ubuntu Touch</a>, added calendaring and phone alarms, and management of data transfers, USB connections, and bluetooth connections.</li>
<li>Expanded test coverage in all my projects and introduced tests into several inherited projects that were difficult to test, wrote harnesses for integration testing, and wrote reusable test mocks.</li>

<span class="years">2008 - 2012</span>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Led a small group of volunteer developers on <a href="http://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a>, a popular open source networking app. Planned features, triaged bugs, reviewed/committed patches, and coordinated developers, sysadmins, testers, and forum assistants.</li>
<li>Negotiated with prominent Linux distributions (e.g. <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE</a> and <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>) to ship with Transmission preinstalled and also with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fon_(company)">Fon</a> to preinstall on Fonera routers. Wrote and documented a JSON-RPC <a href="https://github.com/charlesk/transmission/blob/master/extras/rpc-spec.txt">extension API</a> that led to dozens of third-party apps on virtually every platform, expanding Transmission's reach beyond our team's own resources.</li>
<li>Wrote Transmission's backend to be highly efficient. The app uses about <a href="http://charleskerr.com/resume/bittorrent-benchmarks.html">half the memory and a third less CPU</a> as similar apps, appealing to users on resource-limited systems (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160725110733/http://www.howtogeek.com:80/100142/how-to-install-the-transmission-bitorrent-client-on-your-router-dd-wrt/">routers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211051319/http://stuffablog.com/how-to-install-transmission-daemon-on-raspberry-pi/i">Raspberry Pis</a>, and metered cloud.)</li>
<li>Primary author of Transmission’s web UI and the Qt client, which began as personal projects to learn JavaScript, CSS, and Qt but gained user interest and became shipping code.</li>
<li>Wrote upstream patches accepted by projects such as <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a>, <a href="http://libevent.org/">libevent</a>, and <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gmime/stable/">GMime</a>.</li>

<li>Co-wrote the <a href="http://www.wdssii.org/">WDSS-II</a> display, a large-scale data visualization tool for severe weather research. Contributed to the OpenGL rendering, wrote much of the UI, and ported it from Linux to Windows.</li>
<li>Co-wrote <a href="http://charleskerr.com/resume/cimm0102.pdf">OPUP</a>, a 2D visualization system for the US Air Force that combines regional radar data for visualization and algorithm processing. Worked closely with customers during delivery, including documentation authoring, acceptance testing, and onsite visits to explain code base and operations to IT staff.</li>
<li>Collaborated with research meteorologists to determine code and system requirements for their weather algorithms. Wrote and maintained code for weather algorithms and their WDSS-II visualization.</li>
<li>Identified and fixed bottlenecks in multi-radar data at the code level and helped coordinate weather algorithm processes at the system level.</li>
