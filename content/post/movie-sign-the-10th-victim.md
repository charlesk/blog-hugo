Every now and then I get together with a group of friends for Bad Movie Night. The worse the movie, the better. Why would anyone willingly do this? Maybe it's a side-effect of being [MST3K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000) fans.

We've gone through a lot of the "popular" bad movies -- [The Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room_(film)), [Birdemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdemic:_Shock_and_Terror), [Manos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manos:_The_Hands_of_Fate) -- but then we came across an odd pick: 1965's [The 10th Victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10th_Victim). I'd never heard of it, and while it's not a bad movie, it's also not *not* a bad movie either...

The 10th Victim is an early version of the [Deadly Game](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame) trope that would be later used in Death Race 2000 (1975), The Running Man (1987), and The Hunger Games (2012). In The 10th Victim, people around the world tune in to watch The Big Hunt, where two players are chosen at random by computer to be hunter and victim. Each must try to kill the other first. The Big Hunt is very popular, so kills in its service are legal. Standard B-Movie stuff, but the ["Amusing ourselves to death"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) theme was pretty new to film in the 1960s. The idea was still fresh decades later when Death Race 2000 and The Running Man followed this movie's template of using the Deadly Game trope to satirize TV entertainment, and this movie does it better than either of them.

# It *Looks* Great...

The first thing you'll notice when watching is that the film flat-out *looks* sensational.
It's one of the most 60's films you'll ever see,
a hyper-stylized view of the era with a constant stream of 60's Pop eye candy.

For fans of the 60s Eurospy "look" -- e.g.
[Diabolik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger%3A_Diabolik),
[Danger 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_5),
[The Prisoner](http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-37232329),
The Steed & Peel [Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_%28TV_series%29),
[Spyvibe](https://spyvibe.blogspot.com/),
or even Austin Powers (more on that later) --
this is essential viewing.

# ...But What Am I Looking At?

[Marcello Mastroianni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcello_Mastroianni) and 
[Ursula Andress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Andress) play the lead roles.
Mastroianni had starred in La Dolce Vita a few years before,
and Andress was fresh off being the first "Bond Girl" in Dr. No.
Although this *is* a 60s Pop comicbook movie,
it's a romantic comedy and, at times, a drama.
Mastroianni is solid as Marcello.
Andress excels when the movie calls for style (as you'd expect from the first Bond Girl),
and, while not as strong an actor as Mastroianni, does well enough when acting is called for.

Mixing romantic comedy, drama, 60s Pop, and comicbook is not easy,
and The 10th Victim doesn't always pull it off.
It drags in the middle, trying but failing to balance the satire and romantic plot.
Likewise, it was not a commercial success. Audiences didn't seem to know what to make of it:

 * Is it science fiction? Yes.
 * Is it a psychedelic movie? Yes.
 * Romantic comedy? Yes.
 * A black comedy? Oh, yes.
 * A straight drama? Sometimes.
 * Eurospy? ...maybe?

# Summary

Despite its weaknesses, though, there's a lot to like about this movie:
it's fine as a black comedy,
it's interesting as an early entry into subversive science fiction film,
and -- especially -- it's a visual feast of 60s Pop.
Plus, it's only 92 minutes long. If any of the above sounds interesting, what do you have to lose?

**Rating: 6 out of 10**

# Ming Tea

One piece of trivia: this movie was an inspiration for Mike Myers' Austin Powers character.
Before his movies, Austin was the lead vocalist of faux retro-mod band ["Ming Tea"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Tea),
a [Spinal Tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_Tap_(band))-style band
which played real music but whose members performed in character.
Ming Tea's members, who included Myers, Susanna Hoffs (The Bangles), and Matthew Sweet,
each performed in a different 60s stereotype character.
The band's name comes from one of The 10th Victim's satirical ads:
Dancing teacups, singing Ming Tea's praises, danced on-camera as Marcello and Caroline's hunt reached its climax.

The fembot bra guns were also lifted from The 10th Victim, where Andress kills a victim in this fashion in the opening scenes:
