Every now and then I get together with a group of friends for Bad Movie Night. The worse the movie, the better. Why would anyone willingly do this? Maybe it's a side-effect of being [MST3K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000) fans.

We've gone through a lot of the "popular" bad movies -- [The Room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Room_(film)), [Birdemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdemic:_Shock_and_Terror), [Manos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manos:_The_Hands_of_Fate) -- but then we came across an odd pick: 1965's [The 10th Victim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_10th_Victim). I'd never heard of it, and while it's not a bad movie, it's also not *not* a bad movie either...

The 10th Victim is an early version of the [Deadly Game](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame) trope that would be later used in Death Race 2000 (1975), The Running Man (1987), and The Hunger Games (2012). In The 10th Victim, people around the world tune in to watch The Big Hunt, where two players are chosen at random by computer to be hunter and victim. Each must try to kill the other first. The Big Hunt is very popular, so kills in its service are legal. Standard B-Movie stuff, but the ["Amusing ourselves to death"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) theme was pretty new to film in the 1960s. The idea was still fresh decades later when Death Race 2000 and The Running Man followed this movie's template of using the Deadly Game trope to satirize TV entertainment, and this movie does it better than either of them.

# It *Looks* Great...

The first thing you'll notice when watching is that the film flat-out *looks* sensational.
It's one of the "grooviest" films you'll ever see,
with scene after scene of 60s Pop eye candy:

For fans of the 60s Eurospy "look" -- e.g.
[Diabolik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger%3A_Diabolik),
[Danger 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_5),
[The Prisoner](http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-37232329),
The Steed & Peel [Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_%28TV_series%29),
[Spyvibe](https://spyvibe.blogspot.com/),
or even Austin Powers (more on that later) --
this is essential viewing.

# ...but What Am I Looking At?

The 10th Victim was not a commercial success. Audiences didn't seem to know what to make of it.
It's a dark comedy,
but's also science fiction,
a romantic comedy,
a sometimes-serious drama,
and even kind of a Eurospy movie..
It doesn't always wear all these hats well:
it drags in the middle, seemingly not knowing whether to be a romance or satire at times.

But even then, the two leads
[Marcello Mastroianni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcello_Mastroianni) and 
[Ursula Andress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_Andress) keep things interesting.
Mastroianni had starred in La Dolce Vita a few years before,
Andress was fresh off being the first "Bond Girl" in Dr. No,
and they do have a screen chemistry that fits this strange movie well.

# Conclusion

Despite its weaknesses, there's a lot to enjoy about The 10th Victim.
It's funny,
it's an interesting early subversive SF film,
Mastroianni puts in some good acting,
and -- especially -- it's a visual feast of 60s Pop.

Also, it's only 92 minutes long.
What do you have to lose?

# Trivia Time: Ming Tea

This movie was an inspiration for Mike Myers' Austin Powers character.
Before his movies, Austin was the lead vocalist of faux retro-mod band ["Ming Tea"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Tea),
a [Spinal Tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_Tap_(band))-style band
which played real music but whose members performed in character.
Ming Tea's members, who included Myers, Susanna Hoffs (The Bangles), and Matthew Sweet,
each performed in a different 60s stereotype character.

The band's name comes from one of The 10th Victim's satirical ads:
Dancing teacups, singing Ming Tea's praises, danced on-camera as Marcello and Caroline's hunt reached its climax.

Also, who could forget Austin Powers' fembot bra guns?
Those are also from The 10th Victim, where Andress kills one of her victims this way in the opening scenes:
