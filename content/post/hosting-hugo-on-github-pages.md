This is the second half of my "Bootstrapping This Site" series -- you may want to check out [part one]({{< relref "bootstrapping-this-site.md" >}}) first.

At the end of that post, `hugo server` was correctly generating the site so that it could be read from http://localhost:1313/ . In this second (shorter) article, I discuss how to get that content pushed onto [my own domain](http://charleskerr.com/). There three parts to this:

1. Configuring the custom domain's DNS
2. Adding a CNAME file to the top-level of username.github.io
3. Getting the Hugo-generated files over to username.github.io

Configure the custom domain's DNS
=================================

[Github](https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/) and [David Singer](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/) both have good articles on DNS setup for GitHub Pages, but the action items are pretty simple: point my domain's DNS records to GitHub's servers, and set the CNAME record to $username.github.io.  [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) is my registrar, and both of these things can be done through their Dashboard > Manage domain > Advanced DNS page:

Add a CNAME file
================

GitHub Pages needs to know about the custom domain. Its [custom domain docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) say this is done with a CNAME file in the toplevel, and [Hugo's docs](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/) say to add it to the `static` directory. This is straightforward:

    # add CNAME
    ~/s/charlesk-hugo> echo "$yourdomain.com" > static/CNAME

    # confirm it shows up in the toplevel
    ~/s/charlesk-hugo> hugo -t $yourtheme server
    ~/s/charlesk-hugo> wget -q localhost:1313/CNAME -O -
    $yourdomain

    # add it
    ~/s/charlesk-hugo> git add static/CNAME
    ~/s/charlesk-hugo> git commit -m "add CNAME for github pages custom domain"


Generate Files to username.gitub.io
===================================

This is a straightforward step that's explained in Hugo's [tutorials](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/#hosting-personal-organization-pages). Since this is a User Pages site, rather than a project page, content [must](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) be served from username.github.io's master branch. So I have two repos:

1. https://github.com/username/projectname-hugo holds my Hugo content (e.g. themes, markdown files, etc)

2. https://github.com/username/username.github.io holds the files generated by hugo; e.g. my website

3. make username.github.io a submodule in projectname-hugo/public, e.g.:

```
    $ cd projectname-hugo
    $ git submodule add -b master git@github.com:charlesk/charlesk.github.io.git public
```

4. Now when content is generated into public/ by hugo, we can add-commit-push it to make the changes go live. A simple chmod +x deploy.sh script makes this easier:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo -e "\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\033[0m"

# Build the project.
hugo # if using a theme, replace by `hugo -t <yourtheme>`

# Go To Public folder
cd public
# Add changes to git.
git add -A

# Commit changes.
msg="rebuilding site `date`"
if [ $# -eq 1 ]
  then msg="$1"
fi
git commit -m "$msg"

# Push source and build repos.
git push origin master

# Come Back
cd ..
```

5. `./deploy.sh "Your optional commit message"` to send changes to `<username>.github.io` (careful, you may also want to commit changes on the `<your-project>-hugo` repo).

That's it! That's how I generated the pages you're reading now.
